			<h2 epub:type="title">Recognition</h2>
			<p>The new woman came in with a firm and confident tread. She hung her hat on a nail, stood her cane in the corner, and kissed her husband gayly as he was mixing the biscuit for supper.</p>
			<p>“Any luck to-day, dearie?” asked the man as his careworn face took on an anxious expression.</p>
			<p>“The best of luck,” she said with a joyous smile. “The day has come when the world recognizes woman as man’s equal in everything. She is no longer content to occupy a lower plane than his, and is his competitor in all the fields of action. I obtained a position to-day at fifty dollars per week for the entire season.”</p>
			<p>“What is the position?”</p>
			<p>“Female impersonator at the new theater.”</p>
