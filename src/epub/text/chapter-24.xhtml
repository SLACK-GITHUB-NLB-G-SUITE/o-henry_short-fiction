			<p class="jus">Can you inform me where I can buy an interest in a newspaper of some kind? I have some money and would be glad to invest it in something of the sort, if some one would allow me to put in my capital against his experience.</p>

			<p>This was written by a visitor to the State Saengerfest of 1892 while conversing with a member who had just eaten a large slice of limburger cheese.</p>

			<p class="jus">What does an F. F. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>. mean?</p>
			<p class="jright"><span class="smallcaps">Ignorant</span>.</p>
			<p>What does he mean by what? If he takes you by the arm and tells you how much you are like a brother of his in Richmond, he means Feel For Your Vest, for he wants to borrow a five. If he holds his head high and don’t speak to you on the street he means that he already owes you ten and is Following a Fresh Victim.</p>

Yes, she has some rights of her own, and everybody else’s she can scoop in.</p>
