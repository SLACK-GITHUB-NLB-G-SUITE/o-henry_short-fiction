			<h2 epub:type="title">Vanity</h2>
			<p>A poet sang a song so wondrous sweet,</p>
			<p>That toiling thousands paused and listened long;</p>
			<p>So lofty, strong, and noble were his themes,</p>
			<p>It seemed that strength supernal swayed his song.</p>
			<p>He, god-like, chided poor, weak, weeping man, And bade him dry his foolish, shameful tears. Taught that each soul on its proud self should lean,</p>
			<p>And from that rampart scorn all earth-born fears.</p>
			<p>The poet groveled on a fresh-heaped mound Raised oâ€™er the grave of one he fondly loved,</p>
			<p>And cursed the world, and drenched the sod with tears,</p>
			<p>And all the flimsy mockery of his precepts proved.</p>
