			<h2 epub:type="title">A Fatal Error</h2>
			<p>What are you looking so glum about?”</p>
			<p>asked a Houston man as he dropped into a friend’s office on Christmas Day.</p>
			<p>“Same old fool break of putting a letter in the wrong envelope, and Pm afraid to go home. My wife sent me down a note by the hired man an hour ago, telling me to send her ten dollars, and asking me to meet her here at the office at three o’clock and go shopping with her. At the same time I got a bill for ten dollars from a merchant I owe, asking me to remit. I scribbled off a note to the merchant saying: ‘Can’t possibly do it. I’ve got to meet another little thing to-day that won’t be put off.’ I made the usual mistake and sent the merchant the ten dollars and my wife the note.”</p>
			<p>“Can’t you go home and explain the mistake to your wife?”</p>
			<p>“You don’t know her. I’ve done all I can. I’ve taken out an accident policy for $10,000 good for two hours, and I expect her here in fifteen minutes. Tell all the boys good-by for me, and if you meet a lady on the stairs as you go down keep close to the wall.”</p>
