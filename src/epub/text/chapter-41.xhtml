			<h2 epub:type="title">City Perils</h2>
			<p>Jeremiah Q. Dilworthy lives away up on San Jacinto Street. He walks home every night. On January first, he promised his wife he would not take another drink in a year. He forgot his promise and on Tuesday night we met some of the boys, and when he started home about nine o’clock he was feeling a trifle careless.</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dilworthy was an old resident of Houston, and on rainy nights he always walked in the middle of the street, which is well paved.</p>
			<p>Alas! if <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Dilworthy had only remembered the promise made his wife!</p>
			<p>He started out all right, and just as he was walking up San Jacinto Street he staggered over to one side of the street.</p>
			<p>A policeman standing on the comer heard a loud yell of despair, and turning, saw a man throw up his arms and then disappear from sight. Before the policeman could call some one who could swim the man had gone for the third and last time.</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Jeremiah Q. Dilworthy had fallen into the sidewalk.</p>
