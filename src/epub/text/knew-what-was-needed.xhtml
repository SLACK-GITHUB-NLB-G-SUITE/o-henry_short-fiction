			<h2 epub:type="title">Knew What Was Needed</h2>
			<p>A gentleman from Ohio, who has come South on a hunting trip, arrived in H6uston, rather late one night last week, and on his way to a hotel stoppecLin a certain saloon to get a drink. A colored man was behind the bar temporarily and served him with what he wanted. The gentleman had his shotgun in its case, and he laid it upon the bar while waiting.</p>
			<p>“Is there any game about here?” he asked, after paying for his drink.</p>
			<p>“I guess dey is, boss,” said the colored man, looking doubtfully at the gun on the counter, “but you jest wait a minute, boss, till I fixes you up in better shape.”</p>
			<p>He opened a drawer and handed the gentleman a six-shooter.</p>
			<p>“You take dis, Boss,” he said. “Dat dar gun ob yourn am too long fur you to get quick action in de game what we hab here. Now you jest go up dem steps and knock free times on de doah to your left.”</p>
