			<h2 epub:type="title">A Matter of Loyalty</h2>
			<p>Two men were talking at the Grand Central depot yesterday, and one of them was telling about a difficulty he had recently been engaged in.</p>
			<p>“He said I was the biggest liar ever heard in Texas,” said the man, “and I jumped on him and blacked both his eyes in about a minute.”</p>
			<p>“That’s right,” said the other man, “a man ought to resent an imputation of that sort right away.”</p>
			<p>“It wasn’t exactly that,” said the first speaker, “but Tom Achiltree is a second cousin of mine, and I won’t stand by and hear any man belittle him.”</p>
