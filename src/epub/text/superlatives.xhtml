			<blockquote>
				<p>“I think the song that is sweetest Is the one that is never sung;</p>
				<p>That lies in the heart of the singer,</p>
				<p>Too grand for mortal tongue.”</p>
				<p>—Some poet or other.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The hen egg that is largest</p>
			<p>Was the one she never laid;</p>
			<p>And the biggest bet in all the world Was the one we never made.</p>
			<p>And the biggest fight that Dallas had Was the one that did not go;</p>
			<p>And the finest poet in the world was the one That didn’t write “Beautiful Snow.”</p>
			<p>The finest country in all the world Has never yet been explored,</p>
			<p>And the finest artesian well in town Has not at this time been bored.</p>
