			<p>Above all hangs the dreadful night.</p>
			<p>He pleads with her.</p>
			<p>His hand is on her arm.</p>
			<p>They stand in the cold, solemn night, gazing into a brilliantly lighted room. His face is white and terror-stricken. Hers is willful, defiant, and white with the surging impulse of destiny.</p>
			<p>Ten miles away on the Harrisburg road a draggle-tailed rooster crows, but the woman does not falter.</p>
			<p>He pleads with her.</p>
			<p>She shakes off his hand with a gesture of loathing, and takes a step forward toward the lighted room.</p>
			<p>He pleads with her.</p>
			<p>Crystal flakes of moonlight quiver on the trees above; star dust flecks the illimitable rim of the Ineligible. The whicheverness of the Absolute reigns pre-eminent.</p>
			<p>Sin is below; peace above.</p>
			<p>The whip of the north wind trails a keen lash upon them. Carriages sweep by. Frost creeps upon the stones, lies crustily along parapets, spangles and throws back in arctic scintillation the moonâ€™s challenging rays.</p>
			<p>He pleads with her.</p>
			<p>At last she turns, conquered.</p>
			<p>He has refused to treat to oysters.</p>
