			<h2 epub:type="title">Nothing to Say</h2>
			<p>You can tell your paper,” the great man said,</p>
			<p>I refused an interview.</p>
			<p>I have nothing to say on the question, sir,</p>
			<p>Nothing to say to you.”</p>
			<p>And then he talked till the sun went down And the chickens went to roost:</p>
			<p>And he seized the coat of the poor Post man And never his hold he loosed.</p>
			<p>And the sun went down and the moon came up, And he talked till the dawn of day;</p>
			<p>Though he said, “On this subject mentioned by you,</p>
			<p>I have nothing whatever to say.”</p>
			<p>And down the reporter dropped to sleep,</p>
			<p>And flat on the floor he lay;</p>
			<p>And the last he heard was the great man’s words: “I have nothing at all to say.”</p>
