			<h2 epub:type="title">Her Ruse</h2>
			<p>How do I keep John home of nights?” asked a Houston lady cf a friend the other day.</p>
			<p>“Well, I struck a plan once by a sudden inspiration, and it worked very nicely. John had been in a habit of going down town every night after supper and staying until ten or eleven o’clock. One night he left as usual, and after going three or four blocks he found he had forgotten his umbrella and came back for it. I was in the sitting room reading, and he slipped in the room on his tiptoes and came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes. John expected me to be very much startled, I suppose, but I only said softly, Ts that you, Tom?’ John hasn’t been down town at night since.”</p>
