			<h2>The Good Boy</h2>
			<h3>(Mostly in Words of One Syllable) </h3>
			<p>James was a good boy.</p>
			<p>He w’ould not tease his cat or his dog.</p>
			<p>He went to school.</p>
			<p>One day as he went home he saw a la-dy cross the street, and some rude boys tried to guy her.</p>
			<p>James took the la-dy by the hand and led her to a safe place.</p>
			<p>“Oh, fie!” he said to the boys. “For shame, to talk so to the nice la-dy. A good, kind boy will be mild and love to help the old.”</p>
			<p>At this the boys did rail and laugh.</p>
			<p>“Oh, boys,” said James, “do not be rude and speak so harsh. At home, I have a dear old grandma, and this kind la-dy may be one, too.”</p>
			<p>The la-dy took James by the ear and said: “You contemptible little rapscallion. I’ve a good mind to spank you until you can’t navigate.</p>
			<p>Grandmother, indeed! I’m only twenty-nine my last birthday, and I don’t feel a day over eighteen. Now, you clear out, or I’ll slap you good.”</p>
