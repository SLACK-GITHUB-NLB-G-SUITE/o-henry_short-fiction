			<h2>The Pewee</h2>
			<p>In the hush of the drowsy afternoon.</p>
			<p>When the very mind on the breast of June Lies settled, and hot white tracery Of the shattered sunlight flitters free</p>
			<p>Through the unstinted leaves to the pied cool sward,</p>
			<p>On a dead tree branch sings the saddest bard Of the birds that be.</p>
			<p>’Tis the lone pewee;</p>
			<p>Its note is a sob, and its song is pitched In a single key like a soul bewitched To a mournful minstrelsy.</p>
			<p>“Pewee, Pewee,” doth it ever cry;</p>
			<p>A sad, sweet, minor threnody</p>
			<p>That threads the aisles of the dim hot grove</p>
			<p>Like a tale of a wrong or a vanished love,</p>
			<p>And the fancy comes that the wee dun bird Perchance was a maid, and her heart was stirred By some lover’s rhyme In a golden time,</p>
			<p>And broke when the world turned false and old; And her dreams grew dark and her faith grew cold,</p>
			<p>In some fairy far-off clime.</p>
			<p>And her soul crept into the pewee’s breast;</p>
			<p>And forever she cries with a strange unrest For something lost, in the afternoon;</p>
			<p>For something missed from the lavish June;</p>
			<p>For the heart, that died in the long ago;</p>
			<p>For the livelong pain that pierceth so;</p>
			<p>Thus the pewee cries,</p>
			<p>While the evening lies</p>
			<p>Steeped in the languorous still sunshine,</p>
			<p>Rapt, to the leaf and the bough and the vine, Of some hopeless paradise.</p>
