			<h2 epub:type="title">A Green Hand</h2>
			<p>I shall never again employ any but experienced salesmen, who thoroughly understand the jewelry business,” said a Houston jeweler to a friend yesterday.</p>
			<p>You see, at Christmas time we generally need more help, and sometimes employ people who can sell goods, but are not familiar with the fine points of the business. Now, that young man over there is thoroughly good and polite to every one, but he has just lost me one of my best customers.”</p>
			<p>“How was that?” asked the friend.</p>
			<p>‘A man who always trades with us came in with his wife last week and with her assistance selected a magnificent diamond pin that he had promised her for a Christmas present and told this young man to lay it aside for him till to-day.</p>
			<p>“I see, said the friend, “and he sold it to someone else and disappointed him.”</p>
			<p>“It’s plain you don’t know much about married men, said the jeweler. “That idiot of a clerk actually saved the pin for him and he had to buy it.”</p>
