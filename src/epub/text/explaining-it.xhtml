			<p>A member of the Texas Legislature from one of the eastern counties was at the chrysanthemum show at Turner Hall last Thursday night, and was making himself agreeable to one of the lady managers.</p>
			<p>“You were in the House at the last session, I believe?” she inquired.</p>
			<p>“Well, madam,” he said, “I was in the House, but the Senate had me for about forty-five dollars when we adjourned.”</p>
