			<h2 epub:type="title">Toddlekins</h2>
			<p>Toddlekins climbed up the long, long stair;</p>
			<p>Chubby and fat and round was he; With rosy cheeks and curling hair, Jolly and fair and gay was he.</p>
			<p>Toddlekins knocked on the office door; Within at a desk a stern man sat;</p>
			<p>Wrote with a pen while a frown he wore, When he heard on the door a rat-tat-tat.</p>
			<p>Toddlekins cried, “Oh please let me in! I’ve come to see you, the door is fast!”</p>
			<p>Oh, voice so soft, it will surely win The heart of the stern, cold man at last!</p>
			<p>But he heeded not the pleading cry Of Toddlekins out on the lonely stair;</p>
			<p>And Toddlekins left with a sorrowful sigh, Toddlekins round, and chubby and fair,</p>
			<p>Oh, man so stem, when you stand and plead At the door of your Father’s house on high;</p>
			<p>What if he, merciless, pay no heed;</p>
			<p>Pitiless, turns from your helpless cry!</p>
			<p>But the man wrote on with a stony stare;</p>
			<p>He was an editor, poor and ill;</p>
			<p>And Toddlekins, chubby and round and fair,</p>
			<p>Was a butcher that brought a big meat bill.</p>
