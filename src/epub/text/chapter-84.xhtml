			<h2>Charge of the White Brigade</h2>
			<p>Mehitabel, Claribel, Bessie, and Sue</p>
			<p>All in white lawn and ribbons pale blue. Went into a drug store; each sat on a stool,</p>
			<p>And called for some phosphate to make them all cool.</p>
			<p>“Oh! what is that big copper thing over there?” Asked Bessie the gay one, asked Bessie the fair. “Why that,” said the clerk, “is the thing with which we</p>
			<p>Charge the phosphate and soda we sell, don’t you see?”</p>
			<p>“How nice,” said bright Bessie and then they all rose,</p>
			<p>And shook out their ruffles and beautiful clothes; “Please charge those we had,” said the girls⁠—then they flew,</p>
			<p>Mehitabel, Claribel, Bessie, and Sue.</p>
