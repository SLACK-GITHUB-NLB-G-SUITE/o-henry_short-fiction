			<h2 epub:type="title">Her Failing</h2>
			<p>They were two Houston girls, and they were taking a spin on their wheels. They met a fluffy girl who didn’t “bike,” out driving with a young man in a buggy.</p>
			<p>Of course they must say something about her⁠—as this is a true story and they were real, live girls⁠—so one of them said:</p>
			<p>“I never did like that girl.”</p>
			<p>“Why?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, she’s too effeminate.”</p>
