			<h2>A Sure Method</h2>
			<p>The editor sat in his palatially furnished</p>
			<p>A sanctum bending over a mass of manuscripts, resting his beetling brow upon his hand. It wanted but one hour of the time of going to press and there was that editorial on the Venezuelan question to write. A pale, intellectual youth approached him with a rolled manuscript tied with a pink ribbon.</p>
			<p>“It is a little thing,” said the youth, “that I dashed off in an idle moment.”</p>
			<p>The editor unrolled the poem and glanced down the long row of verses. He then drew from his pocket a $20 bill and held it toward the poet. A heavy thud was heard, and at the tinkle of an electric bell the editor’s minions entered and carried the lifeless form of the poet away.</p>
			<p>“That’s three to-day,” muttered the great editor as he returned the bill to his pocket. “It works better than a gun or a club and the coroner always brings in a verdict of heart failure.”</p>
