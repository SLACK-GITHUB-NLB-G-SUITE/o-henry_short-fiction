			<h2 epub:type="title">Grounds for Uneasiness</h2>
			<p>When Sousa’s Band was in Houston a week or so ago, Professor Sousa was invited to dine with a prominent citizen who had met him while on a visit to the North.</p>
			<p>This gentleman, while a man of high standing and reputation, has made quite a fortune by the closest kind of dealing. His economies in the smallest matters are a fruitful subject of discussion in his neighborhood, and one or two of his acquaintances have gone so far as to call him stingy.</p>
			<p>After dinner Professor Sousa was asked to play upon the piano, of which instrument he is a master, and he did so, performing some lovely Beethoven sonatas, and compositions by the best masters.</p>
			<p>While playing a beautiful adagio movement in a minor key, the Professor caught sight of his host casting uneasy glances out of the window and appearing very restless and worried. Presently the Houston gentleman came over to the piano and touched Professor Sousa on the shoulder.</p>
			<p>“Say,” he said, “please play something livelier. Give us a jig or a quickstep⁠—something fast and jolly.”</p>
			<p>“Ah,” said the Professor, “this sad music affects your spirits then?”</p>
			<p>“No,” said the host, “I’ve got a man in the back yard sawing wood by the day, and he’s been keeping time to your music for the last half hour.”</p>
