			<h2 epub:type="title">Eugene Field</h2>
			<p>No gift his genius might have had Of titles high, in church and state, Could charm him as the one he bore,</p>
			<p>Of children’s poet-laureate.</p>
			<p>He smilingly pressed aside his bays And laurel garlands that he won, And bowed his head for baby hands To place a daisy wreath upon.</p>
			<p>He found his kingdom in the ways,</p>
			<p>Of little ones he loved so well,</p>
			<p>For them he tuned his lyre and sang.</p>
			<p>Sweet simple songs of magic spell.</p>
			<p>Ah! greater feat to storm the gates Of children’s pure and cleanly hearts,</p>
			<p>Than to subdue a warring world By stratagems and doubtful arts.</p>
			<p>A tribute paid by chanting choirs And pealing organs rises high;</p>
			<p>But soft and clear, somewhere he hears Through all, a child’s low lullaby.</p>
