			<h2 epub:type="title">A Personal Insult</h2>
			<p>Young lady in Houston became engaged last summer to one of the famous shortstops of the Texas baseball league.</p>
			<p>Last week he broke the engagement, and this is the reason why.</p>
			<p>He had a birthday last Tuesday and she sent him a beautiful bound and illustrated edition of Coleridge’s famous poem, “The Ancient Mariner.”</p>
			<p>The hero of the diamond opened the book with a puzzled look.</p>
			<p>“What’s dis bloomin’ stuff about, anyways?” he said, and read:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>It is the Ancient Mariner</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he stoppeth one of three⁠—</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The famous shortstop threw the book out the window, stuck out his chin and said:</p>
			<p>“No Texas sis can gimme de umpire face like dat. I swipes nine daisy cutters outer ten dat comes in my garden, I do.”</p>
